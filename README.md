This is a simulation on gazebo of the MIT RACECAR which is a 1/10th scale autonomous vehicle for education and research. It serves as the learning tool for a variety of courses spanning from high school to graduate school level, and 1serves as a platform for cutting-edge robotics research. The platform was developed at MIT in 2014, and it has been used in various teaching and research activities at MIT and elsewhere since then.

Simulates an RC car in the MIT tunnel.
